Intranet based project management suite created in ColdFusion, around the early 2000's.

Back then clear communication in the process of creating, doing projects had a few major obstacles.

1. Ever changing priorities of what management wants done.
2. No clear way to see the progress of each project
3. Help articulate the project in better detail, so as to avoid confusion

This was simple and primitive, and no doubt way behind the times. But it worked for the company I created it for,
a national ecommerce/mail order retailer.

Future Goals:
1. Install ColdFusion, so i can share screenshots of the existing old project
2. Rewrite it in PHP/mySQL
